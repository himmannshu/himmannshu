👋 Hi there! I’m Himanshu—a programmer, anime enthusiast, and a self-proclaimed decent Indian chef (seriously, my curries are worth a spoon 🍴).

💻 By day, I’m a master’s student in Computer Science diving into AR, AI & ML in Financial Analytics, Advanced Database Systems, and Full Stack Deep Learning. By night, I’m tinkering away on projects, debugging (sometimes cursing), and occasionally finding those elusive “Aha!” moments.

🌟 Here’s what you’ll find on my GitHub:

🧠 Machine learning projects that might just make studying a bit more fun.
🛠️ Cool tools for tackling data and optimization challenges.
💡 Random experiments fueled by curiosity and caffeine.
🎾 When I’m not coding, I’m probably chasing tennis balls, exploring the world of deep learning one chapter at a time, or trying to flip a perfect dosa without making a mess.

🔗 Let’s connect, collaborate, and maybe even build something awesome together!
